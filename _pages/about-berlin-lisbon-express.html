          <h2>Creation</h2>

          <strong>cycle-man.com</strong> was designed in 2016 to find hosts during my
          <a href="/bike-tours/cycling-across-europe.html">bike tour from Berlin to Lisbon</a>. <br>
                  Then, its content has been extended to help people planning their routes,
                  providing with with tracks, maps, which have been recorded on the way. The website is edited,
              designed by myself. Any questions or suggestions please drop me a message on instagram.
