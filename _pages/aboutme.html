            <p>Dear Reader,</p>
             <p>Welcome! Good to have you on this page!</p>
              <p>Maxime writing here.</p>
              <p>For a living, I do work in the web marketing where I spend a lot of time to improve websites in making them simpler and more user-friendly. It was finally time for me to realize my own website!</p>
              <p>My job is all about understanding people/customers, their behaviour, and more particularly their "journeys". You have no idea how many times per day we pronounce the word "journey", always referring to customers, of course. When a marketer hears journey, he thinks costs, turnover, cost income ratio... It is very bad. Dear marketer reader, I am about to change that: Journey is good. Journey is bike. Journey you like.</p>
              <p>My crazyness for bike touring started two years ago, as I did a first bike tour from Rome to Marseille. I fell in love with my bike (I hope you have all visited its <a href="setup.html">own dedicated page</a>), the route, the speed, the landscape, the whole impression of freedom it conveys, the life on the road reduced to its simplest aspects,  the people I met on the way and who hosted me. Arrived in Marseille, I knew I will renew this experience.</p>  
              <p>So here I am, back on the road again!</p>
