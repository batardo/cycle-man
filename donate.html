            <h1><i>Travelling is not a hobby for everyone</i></h1>
            <p>Not all journeys are as nice as Berlin-Lisbon, not everyone can cross borders so easily. Journeys are not always wanted, they are not always a hobby.
            However, we have in Berlin every weeks lots of refugees coming from a long journey. 
            "Refugees or not Refugees" is no longer the question. The biggest issue we face now is how to integrate them.</p>
            <p>It is exactly what the association <a href="http://www.freunde-islamische-kunst-pergamonmuseum.de/index.php?de" target="_blank">"Museum of Islamic Art"</a> is working on. They help refugees to become museum guides. 
            I believe it's a great way to build a link between our cultures!
